# **Student-Marks-Prediction**
**This is a simple Prediction using Supervised ML which uses Linear Regression to predict marks of student based on number of hours studied.**
## **Supervised Machine Learning:**
**The majority of practical machine learning uses supervised learning. Supervised learning is where you have input variables (x) and an output variable (Y) and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output Y = f(X) . The goal is to approximate the mapping function so well that when you have new input data (x) that you can predict the output variables (Y) for that data.**


## Here, a regression algorithm predicted student's score based on number of hours he/she studied after being trained on a dataset of number of hours and marks obtained that are properly labeled.
